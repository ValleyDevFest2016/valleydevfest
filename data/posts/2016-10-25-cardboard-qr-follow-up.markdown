# CardBoard QR code

If you threw out the cover of your cardboard swag, there was a QR code on it. That QR code leads you to the CardBoard app in the app store,
and once you start that app and scan the QR code again, it helps registering your cardboard and picking up it's parameters. There are many different
cardboards and they differ by the dimensions, the parameter and distance of the lenses and other properties. These all affect the way the phone has
to transform the content for an ideal view. A VR content optimized for a different type of cardboard can look blurry, unfocused. So here is the
QR code if you don't have it around you any more:

## Other important information:

* It got easier to rate your session: with our recent modification you don't have to sign-in any more to submit your ratings.
You also have the opportunity to submit additional comments besides the rating factors, please take advantage of that so we can make next
year's conference better.
* We'll gather and communicate to you the session materials (slide decks, resources) during the upcoming weeks. You may get an email,
but we'll also upload them to the site, and you'll be able to find them on the session details card, just like the ratings
(did I already mention to rate your session? ;).

Thank you so much for your participation again!
