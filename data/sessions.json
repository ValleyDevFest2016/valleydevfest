The httpclient shipped with android is buggy and outdated, Java's programming model does not encourage developers to use separate threads for non-ui related tasks, use of anonymous inner classes for listeners create a burden and ugly code and of course this list goes on. This talk will focus on seven great open source libraries which do fix Android's programming model, the way jquery fixes javascript. The libraries will be covered with example code, advantages, disadvantages, internals and when to use them.",

Actually it is more than that, Design Patterns are decades of collective wisdom to provide solutions for common problems in software. Android makes heavy use of design patterns both internally and at the SDK level. This talk will focus on classical GoF design patterns and how they can be implemented on Android as well as covering patterns which are specific to Android and mobile software ecosystem.",
